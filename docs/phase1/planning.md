## System Name
Medical Certificate Submission and Management System

## Problem Statement
The current medical certificate submission and management process at Sabaragamuwa University is manual and paper-based, leading to delays, increased workload, and errors in record-keeping. Students face difficulties in submitting certificates, while staff struggle with verification, tracking, and storage. The lack of a centralized, digital system also raises concerns about data security, accessibility, and transparency. There is a need for an online medical certificate management system to streamline submission, ensure secure storage, and improve efficiency for both students and administrators.

## Objectives
1. Automate the medical certificate submission process for students
2. Provide medical officers with a centralized platform to review and manage submissions
3. Enable real-time tracking of submission status and decisions
4. Generate statistical reports on medical submissions
