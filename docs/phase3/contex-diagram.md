### Explanation:
- **Students**: The primary users who submit their medical certificates through the system. They interact with the system to provide necessary information about their medical condition and reasons for absence.
- **Medical Officers**: The users responsible for reviewing the submitted medical certificates. They have the authority to approve, reject, or put submissions on hold based on the information provided by students.
- **Medical Submission Management System**: The central system that handles all interactions between students and medical officers. It manages the submission process, stores records, and generates reports.
- **Submission Records**: The database or storage system where all submitted medical certificates and their statuses are stored for future reference and auditing.
- **Statistics Reports**: The output generated by the system that provides insights into the number of submissions, their statuses, and types. This helps in monitoring trends and making informed decisions.
